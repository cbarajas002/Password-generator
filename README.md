# Password-generator



## Description

- My motivation for this project was to test the skills that I learn thru the week in javascript and imply them into this password generator project.
- I built this project to see how well I could handle myself in a hard situation like building a password generator because it took me more then just the exmamples
and work we did in class to complete the project.
- This project solves a few problems like if you need a stong password with numbers, symbols, uppercase or lower case letters this password generator will give you all of those.
Let's say if your grandparents need a password that is simple but also hard for other people to guess it, this password generator will give you that by only generating 
numbers or just letter or just symbles that are easy to remember. 
- I learn threw this project was patients because there was a lot of trial & error but at the end it was worth it and come out looking and working great. I also learn how to create 
atributes for looping, random, and math. 
- The thing that makes my project stand out is how organized I am with my code I write all my variables in line.

 ## Installation 
 
 - Step 1: Go to github 
 - Step 2: open the html link 
 - Step 3: look over my Work portolio 
 - Step 4: Look at the CSS work and How I created design
 - Step 5: Look threw my Javascript and look at the comments I created to give you a little visual on the step I went threw to create this project
 - Step 6: uncomment the comments to see what I console log out 


 ## Usage 
 
 The use of this project can come in handy when you need a quick and short password and don't have time to create one. Also this project can come in use when 
 you need a stong passwork for some top secret information that needs a 128 long passworkd with uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
